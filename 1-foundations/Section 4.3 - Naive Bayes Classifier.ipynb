    "# Naive Bayes Classifier -- Implementation from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple probabilistic machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, particularly in text classification and spam filtering. It is based on Bayes' theorem and the assumption of conditional independence between features. The Naive Bayes classifier calculates the probability of a data instance belonging to a particular class by applying Bayes' theorem, which states: \n",
    "\n",
    "* P(Class|Features) = (P(Features|Class) * P(Class)) / P(Features)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, P(Class|Features) is the probability of the class given the observed features, P(Features|Class) is the probability of the observed features given the class, P(Class) is the prior probability of the class, and P(Features) is the probability of the observed features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"naive\" assumption in Naive Bayes comes from assuming that the features are conditionally independent given the class, meaning that the presence or absence of one feature does not affect the presence or absence of other features. Despite this assumption, Naive Bayes often performs well in practice, especially with large feature spaces. The Naive Bayes classifier calculates the probability of each class for a given data instance and assigns the instance to the class with the highest probability. It can handle both binary and multiclass classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are relatively fast to train and make predictions, and they require a small amount of training data to estimate the necessary probabilities. However, they may suffer from the \"zero probability problem\" if a feature has not been observed in the training data with a particular class. This issue can be addressed using techniques like Laplace smoothing or other smoothing methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Naive Bayes classifier is a simple yet effective probabilistic algorithm for text classification and other classification tasks, particularly when dealing with large feature spaces and limited training data. The goal of this tutorial is to perform text classification \"from scratch\", i.e., without using an implementation of a classifier provided by existing packages such as sklearn. This gives a better intuition how the classifier work."

    "## Implementing a Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes Classifier classifies documents - given by a set of words $\\{w_1, w_2, ..., w_n\\}$ - by calculating the conditional probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(c_i\\ |\\  w_1,w_2,...,w_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for all classes $c_i$, and picking the class with the highest conditional probability. For example, one would assume that $P(c_{pos}\\ |\\  happy,luck,...,vacation)$ has a higher value that $P(c_{pos}\\ |\\  \\text{accident},\\text{bad},...,\\text{traffic})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes' Theorem, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(c_i\\ |\\  w_1,w_2,...,w_n) = \\frac{P(w_1,w_2,...,w_n \\ |\\ c_i)  \\cdot P(c_i)}{P(w_1,w_2,...,w_n)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(c_i)$ is called the prior probability of class $c_i$ and simply reflects the distribution of the different classes in the set of documents. For example, if our dataset of positive and negative documents (i.e., 2 classes) contains 55% positive sentences, $P(c_{pos})=0.55$ and $P(c_{neg})=0.45$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further simplify this calculation. In the end, we are only interested which has the higher probability, $P(c_{pos}\\ |\\  w_1,w_2,...,w_n)$ or $P(c_{neg}\\ |\\  w_1,w_2,...,w_n)$. The absolute values are not important. As such, we can ignore the denominator $P(w_1,w_2,...,w_n)$ since it does not depend on the class $c_i$. We therefore can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(c_i\\ |\\  w_1,w_2,...,w_n) \\propto P(w_1,w_2,...,w_n \\ |\\ c_i)  \\cdot P(c_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we no longer can user \"$=$\", since $P(c_i\\ |\\  w_1,w_2,...,w_n)$ is only proportional to the product on the right-hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $P(w_1,w_2,...,w_n \\ |\\ c_i)$ is difficult to calculate. This is where the \"Naive Bayes\" assumption comes in - that is, we assume that all words $w_1,w_2,...,w_n$ are independent from each other. In general, this assumption does not hold. For example, documents containing \"birthday\" often also contain \"happy\". But it turns out that in practice this assumption hardly affects the results. We can now write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(c_i\\ |\\  w_1,w_2,...,w_n) \\propto P(w_1\\ |\\ c_i)  \\cdot P(w_2\\ |\\ c_i)\\cdot ...  \\cdot P(w_n\\ |\\ c_i)  \\cdot P(c_i) =  P(c_i)\\cdot \\prod P(w_i\\ |\\ c_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $P(w_i\\ |\\ c_i)$ being the probability of finding the word $w_i$ in a document of class $c_i$. In other words, we can say:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_i\\ |\\ c_i) = \\frac{\\#occurrences\\ of\\ w_i\\ in\\ c_i}{\\#words\\ in\\ c_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These values are easy to calculate for a given set of documents. It's all about counting words, that's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this works fine in theory, in practice, two concerns need to be addressed. Firstly, most $P(w_i\\ |\\ c_i)$ are very small probabilities. Thus if a document contains hundreds or even thousands of words, hundreds or thousands of small numbers need to be multiplied. The result is then too small to be represented in a computer and rounded to 0. To avoid this, we calculate the **log probability**. Since the logarithm is a monotonic function, it won't affect the final decision for the classification. Using the rules of logarithm, we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\log{P(c_i\\ |\\  w_1,w_2,...,w_n)} \\propto \\log{P(c_i)}\\cdot \\log{\\sum P(w_i\\ |\\ c_i)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is if $P(w_i\\ |\\ c_i) = 0$, i.e., word $w_i$ never appeared in class $c_i$. This can easily happen if the classifier gets a document with words it has never seen before. From a mathematical perspective this is a problem since $\\log{0}$ is undefined. And even if without considering the logarithm, $P(w_i\\ |\\ c_i) = 0$ would dominate the formula and would make $P(c_i\\ |\\  w_1,w_2,...,w_n) = 0$ no matter how common all other words are. The solution is to assign even unknown words with a very small probability greater than 0. Without going into details, a common approach is *Laplace Smoothing*, which results in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_i\\ |\\ c_i) = \\frac{(\\#occurrences\\ of\\ w_i\\ in\\ c_i)\\ + 1}{(\\#words\\ in\\ c_i) + (\\#words\\ in\\ vocabulary)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing up, we need to calculate 3 types of information:\n",
    "- size of the vocabulary\n",
    "- the log probabilities $\\log{P(c_i)}$\n",
    "- the number of occurrences of all words $w_i$ in the different classes $c_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** To keep it simple, we only consider unigrams here -- that is each $w_i$ represents a single word/token. While supporting bigrams, trigrams, etc. is a straightforward extension, it would make the code somewhat more complex. Here we focus on simplicity to maximize understanding.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes classifier is a popular and simple probabilistic machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, particularly in text classification and spam filtering. It operates based on Bayes' theorem and assumes conditional independence between features. Despite its simplicity and the \"naive\" assumption, Naive Bayes often performs well in practice, especially with large feature spaces. It is fast to train and make predictions and requires a small amount of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When compared to other models, Naive Bayes has several distinct characteristics. Firstly, it assumes independence between features, which can be a limitation when features are dependent on each other. This assumption might cause the model to miss out on valuable correlations in the data. However, Naive Bayes can still perform well in practice, especially when the assumption holds approximately or when there are many irrelevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Naive Bayes is computationally efficient and has low memory requirements. It can handle high-dimensional data and large feature spaces effectively. This makes it suitable for text classification tasks, where the number of possible features (words or n-grams) can be enormous. Compared to more complex models like deep neural networks or support vector machines, Naive Bayes is less prone to overfitting, especially when the training data is limited. It can provide good results with smaller datasets, making it useful in scenarios where large labeled datasets are not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Naive Bayes has its limitations. It assumes that features are independent, which might not hold true in all cases. Additionally, it may struggle with rare or unseen feature combinations, as it assigns zero probabilities to them. This issue can be addressed using smoothing techniques like Laplace smoothing. In summary, the Naive Bayes classifier is a simple and efficient algorithm that performs well in text classification tasks and when dealing with large feature spaces. While it makes the naive assumption of feature independence, it often delivers competitive results and is especially useful with limited training data."
